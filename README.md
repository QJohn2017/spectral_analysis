# Spectral Analysis

This is a program that creates nice pdf's analyzing the high harmonic generation produced by helium due to circularly polarized counterrotating laser fields. The fast fourier transform is done on the electron dipole moment's oscillation, and the polarization of the produced radiation is calculated as well.
